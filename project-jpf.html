                        The assignment for us was to build a website from scratch providing a design for the
                        homepage and landing pages. </p>
                    <p>Because we're creating a complete new website, it would be important to also create a brand

            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <p>What is being offered?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Legal services consisting of providing legal advice and providing legal aid to litigants in
                    legal proceedings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What is the target audience?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Employers and employees, benefit recipients who have a problem with the UWV regarding their
                    benefit, tenants and landlords, litigants who have a dispute with the garage or
                    contractor/handyman, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What are the three main jurisdictions?</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Employment law and redundancies</li>
                <li>Social security law with regard to sickness benefit, invalidity benefit and unemployment
                    benefit,</li>
                <li>Tenancy and consumer legislation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Defining the goals</h2>
            <p>The goal of JPF Juristen is to grow the business and to achieve more sales through more leads, and
                thus ultimately be able to afford more staff.</h2>
            <p>The main goal is therefore lead generation. The website must also show that JPF juristen is larger
                than a sole proprietorship. </p>
            <h2>Wireframing</h2>
            <p>I created wireframes to define the allocation of elements on the pages and to receive feedback from the client
                without them getting distracted by the overall look and feel of the UI.</p>
            <h2>Visual design</h2>
            <p>Our goal was to design in the perspective of the user, which is looking for advice and help with
                their situation. Our approach was therefore to empathize with the user and its situation and to let
                the user feel understood. </p>
            <p>Our approach was to use the phrase “my situation” instead of the formal and sometimes confusing
                “jurisdictions”. But also choosing images that represent an ideal and happy situation with which the
                user would like to relate. We also decided to use formal language to show the user it's been taken
                seriously. The placing of the application form above the first fold would result in generating more
                leads. </p>
            <p>Because we're creating a complete new website, it would be important to also create a brand identity
                that will be remembered and trusted by users. </p>
            <p>After receiving the first feedback from the client and to meet the clients' expectations, we made
                some minor changes to give the design this more professional look and feel which the client wished.
            </p>

            </div>
            <h2>Handoff to engineering</h2>
            <p>We made a separate Adobe XD file with all correct measurements and statuses of components and in
                addition, we included the used photos. </p>
            <h2>Evaluation</h2>
            <p>To evaluate the effectiveness of the website and to see the results of our approach to generate more
                leads, I used tools like Google Analytics and Hotjar. </p>
            <p>The homepage is by far the most visited page, followed by the contact page and the jurisdictions
                page. </p>
            <p>The vast majority of users are desktop users. The first action of 49% of the users is to scroll the
                page. 13% of the users reaches the bottom of the page according to Hotjar. Users scroll past the
                contact form above the first fold. Although, without any marketing campaign there’s already a
                conversion rate of 4% within 2 months after release. Those conversions are either on the homepage or
                contact page.</p>
            <p>The contact form in the current website might be too intrusive and pushing, because the users haven’t
                gotten any information yet about what JPF could do for them. This applies most for the
                situation/jurisdiction pages on which the user lands to read more about a certain topic. </p>
            <h2>A/B testing</h2>
            <p>For that reason, we made some changes in the design of the jurisdiction page to conduct A/B testing.
            </p>
            <p>We decided to make minor changes that made it easier to see the result of our changes. We kept the
                content blocks the same, but changed their position on the page. </p>
            <p>In the new version, the SEO text is placed above the first fold and the form is placed in a new
                contact-section below that. Because the form isn’t directly visible anymore in the first fold, we
                placed a CTA button in the header that brings users to the contact page. Also, there’s still contact
                information visible above the first fold. </p>
            <div class="row my-4">
                <div class="col-6">
                    <img src="content/jpf-ABtest-original.png" class="img-fluid" alt="AB-test-original">
                    <p class="mt-3 text-center"><strong>Original version</strong></p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-6">
                    <img src="content/jpf-ABtest-new.png" class="img-fluid" alt="AB-test-new">
                    <p class="mt-3 text-center"><strong>New version</strong></p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h3>The results</h3>
            <p>A week after the A/B test was online, we could see in Google Optimize that there we’re 40 sessions on
                each version. In this week, there has been new conversions, but not yet on the targeted pages. </p>
            <p>In the original version, there are 4,12 pageviews per session and for the new version 1,66 pageviews
                per sessions. On the original version, there are more pageviews, but still without a conversion.
            </p>
            <p>In terms of bounce percentage, the original version has a percentage of 7,50% and the new one 39,02%.
                Based on the decrease of internal traffic and increase of external traffic on the new version, this
                could indicate that users realize faster if the page contains the information they need. It could
                mean that this landing experience is not meeting the users' expectations</p>
            <p>A next step could be to make an even newer version eventually, a C-test. We could, for example, place
                the
                situations/jurisdictions even higher on the page to establish an easier navigation throughout the
                pages. </p>
            <p>Because there still haven’t been conversions during the moment of evaluation, the A/B will be
                continued until there’s more data available. </p>
