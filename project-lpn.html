    <section>
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>During this project I applied the <strong>double diamond design thinking process</strong> during which I followed the steps discover, define, develop and deliver.</p>
            
            <h2>1. Discovery phase</h2>
            <p>In our discovery phase we facilitated a <strong>discovery kick-off workshop</strong> with the client to identify and frame the problem to be explored and solved.</p>
            
            <div class="about-lpn p-4 my-3">
                <h3>Problem statement</h3>
                <p>In the eyes of client, Leef Puur Natuur appears too much to be a blog and proprietorship. This is a problem because visitors are less likely to know that the content is created by a team of professional food coaches with lots of expertise, which might be leading to lower conversion rates.</p>
                <p>Besides, for the client the website looks outdated and she would it to be freshen up. Now the focus lies too much on blog articles, which could lead to lower conversion rates.</p>
            </div>
            <p>We bundled the information and conclusion into a collaborate de-brief which we discussed with the client to be on the same page with eachother.</p>

            <h3>User research</h3>
            <p>To validate our assumptions, we had to conduct user research. Because of limited budget and time, we were limited to <strong>quantitative user research</strong> by gathering information on the Leef Puur Natuur Facebook group, the community for which buyers of the books get access to and to analyze Google Analytics. </p>
            </p>
            <p>When receiving emails from website visitors, they are always personally directed to the owner/client, assuming users think she is the only contactperson.</p>
            <p>As seen while analyzing Google Analytics, most of the users are female (around 70%). Broadly most users are in the age group of 35-64 years old with the largest age group lying between 45-54 years old (around 20%). The majority of users come from the cities in western Holland and Northern Brabant. </p>
            <p>The average bounce rate is 1,46% which could be explained by the amount of blog articles on which users land which probably contains the information they seek. On average there are 2,63 pages per session. </p>
            <p>Around 20% of the visitor is a returning visitor on the website which means there's a decent group of loyal visitors.</p>
            <p>As seen from statistics, most users first subscribe to the newsletter before buying the book.</p>
            <div class="my-4">
                <img src="content/lpn-google-analytics.png" class="img-fluid" alt="lpn-google-analytics">
            </div>

            <h2>2. Define phase</h2>
            <p>In the define phase of the design thinking process, I formulated <strong>How Might We statements</strong> and hypothesis in order to rephrase challenges as questions. A few HMW statements during the brainstorm session:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HMW help customers trust LPN as a business?</li>
                <li>HMW convey a more professional appearance?</li> 
                <li>HMW let people sign up for the newsletter more easily?</li>   
            </ul>
            <p>To convey a professional but personal feeling to a user, the website might needs to appear less like a blog and more like an organization/company. A team of professional food coaches might provide a more trustworthy and professional feeling instead of the ownership of one food coach.</p>
            <p>Right now, there is no teaminformation available on the website, but only information of the owner, which makes it unclear to users that there's a team behind the organization.</p>
            <p>As seen from research data, most buyers of the book, first subscribe to the newsletter. This way they first get familiar with the product/company before making a purchase. In order to optimize conversion, we could show the newsletter signup more prominently on all landing pages.</p>
           
            <h3>User persona</h3>
            <p>Based on the research and discoveries in the discovery phase, I created a user persona to help understand usersâ€™ needs, experiences, behaviors and goals. I included personality traits, goals, frustrations, motivations and the most used devices.</p>
            <div class="my-4">
                <img src="content/lpn-user-persona.png" class="img-fluid" alt="lpn-user-persona">
            </div>

            <h3>User journey map</h3>
            <p>After defining the user persona, I could start shaping the user journey map to visualize the process that a person goes through in order to accomplish a goal. It also gives the possibility to visualize pain points and opportunities in the user experience. </p>
            <div class="my-4">
                <img src="content/lpn-user-journey-map.png" class="img-fluid" alt="lpn-user-journey-map">
            </div>

            <h2>3. Design phase</h2>
            <p>After the research and ideation was complete, I started mapping out a flat <strong>sitemap</strong> to create an overview of the pages and their relationship to another. It helped deciding the right paths to create a user and SEO friendly structure. It aided us in removing unnecessary pages so we could keep what is important.</p>
            <div class="my-4">
                <img src="content/lpn-sitemap.png" class="img-fluid" alt="lpn-sitemap">
            </div>
            <p>Next, I started creating <strong>lo-fi wireframes</strong> to decide consistent ways for displaying the information and to clarify the overall placing of elements.</p>
            <p>Because of the slightly older target group and the amount of recurring visitors, it might be best to not make massive changes in the design to avoid confusion. Besides that, I used a legible typeface and increased the type to 18px.</p>
            <p>New functionalities were added compared to the old website, like filters and pagination to enhance the user experience.</p>
            <div class="my-4">
                <img src="content/lpn-wireframes.png" class="img-fluid" alt="lpn-wireframes">
            </div>

            <h2>4. Deliver phase</h2>
            <h3>Designsystem</h3>
            <p>To ensure consistency over all interfaces, I created a design system from scratch, displaying different components and states. I also created a unique look and feel for the new website. Using my knowledge of color theory and branding, I choose a color palette to convey a natural, optimistic and calming look.</p>
            <div class="my-4">
                <img src="content/lpn-design-system1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="lpn-design-system">
            </div>
            <div class="my-4">
                <img src="content/lpn-design-system2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="lpn-design-system">
            </div>

            <h3>Hi-fi mockups</h3>
            <p>After a feedback round with the client, I continued to transform the wireframes into hi-fi mockups. I designed the high fidelity mock ups in Figma with weekly discussions and iterations involving all stakeholders.</p>
