                    <p>Leef Puur Natuur (LPN) started as a proprietorship of a Orthomolecular nutrition coach with the goal to help people achieve a healthier lifestyle and future. The website consists of blog articles and healthy recipes. Revenue is coming from the sales of health improving books. Currently the team exists of 7 professional nutritionists. </p>

            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>During this project I applied the <strong>double diamond design thinking process</strong> during which I followed the steps discover, define, develop and deliver.</p>
            
            <h2>1. Discovery phase</h2>
            <p>In our discovery phase we facilitated a <strong>discovery kick-off workshop</strong> with the client to identify and frame the problem to be explored and solved.</p>
            
            <h3>Problem statement</h3>
            <p>Leef Puur Natuur appears too much to be a blog and proprietorship. Instead of emphasizing the products, the focus lies too much on blog articles. This leads most likely to lower conversion rates. Besides that, target audiences are less likely to trust a proprietorship instead of a team of professional food coaches.
            </p>
            
            <h3>User research</h3>
            <p>In order to get to know and empathize with the user, I conducted user research. Because there wasn’t any budget to conduct qualitive user research, I mainly conducted <strong>quantitative user research</strong> by gathering information on the Leef Puur Natuur Facebook group, the community for which buyers of the books get access to and to analyze Google Analytics. 
            </p>
            <p>As seen while analyzing Google Analytics, most of the users is female (around 70%). Broadly most users are in the age group of 35-64 years old with the largest age group lying between 45-54 years old (around 20%). The majority of users come from the cities in western Holland and Northern Brabant. </p>
            <p>The average bounce rate is 1,46% which could be explained by the amount of blog articles on which users land which probably contains the information they seek. On average there are 2,63 pages per session. </p>
            <div class="my-4">
                <img src="content/lpn-google-analytics.png" class="img-fluid" alt="lpn-google-analytics">
            </div>

            <h2>2. Define phase</h2>
            <p>In the define phase of the design thinking process, I formulated <strong>How Might We statements</strong> in order to rephrase challenges as questions. A few HMW statements during the brainstorm session:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HMW make customers feel that the products and information from LPN can be trusted?</li>
                <li>HMW change the appearance to that of a web shop instead of a blog?</li>
                <li>HMW convey a professional but personal feeling to a user?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To convey a professional but personal feeling to a user, the website needs to appear less like a blog and more like an organization/company. It needs to show that there is a team behind the website and that it’s not just a proprietorship.</p>
            <p>In order to optimize conversion, it’s necessary to show the newsletter signup more prominently on all landing pages. As seen from the statistics, buyers of the book first subscribe to the newsletter before ordering the book.</p>

            <h3>User persona</h3>
            <p>Based on the research and discoveries in the discovery phase, I created a user persona to help understand users’ needs, experiences, behaviors and goals. I included personality traits, goals, frustrations, motivations and the most used devices.</p>
            <div class="my-4">
                <img src="content/lpn-user-persona.png" class="img-fluid" alt="lpn-user-persona">
            </div>

            <h3>User journey map</h3>
            <p>After defining the user persona, I could start shaping the user journey map to visualize the process that a person goes through in order to accomplish a goal. It also gives the possibility to visualize pain points and opportunities in the user experience. </p>
            <div class="my-4">
                <img src="content/lpn-user-journey-map.png" class="img-fluid" alt="lpn-user-journey-map">
            </div>

            <h2>3. Design phase</h2>
            <p>After the research and ideation was complete, I started creating <strong>lo-fi wireframes</strong> to decide consistent ways for displaying the information and to clarify the overall placing of elements.</p>
            <p>Because of the slightly older target group and the amount of recurring visitors, it would be best to not make massive changes in the design to avoid confusion. Besides that, I used a legible typeface and increased the type to 18px.</p>
            <p>New functionalities we’re added compared to the old website, like filters and pagination to enhance the user experience.</p>
            <div class="my-4">
                <img src="content/lpn-wireframes.png" class="img-fluid" alt="lpn-wireframes">
            </div>

            <h2>4. Deliver phase</h2>
            <h3>Designsystem</h3>
            <p>To ensure consistency over all interfaces, I created a design system from scratch, displaying different components and states. I also created a unique look and feel for the new website. Using my knowledge of color theory and branding, I choose a color palette to convey a natural, optimistic and calming look.</p>
            <div class="my-4">
                <img src="content/lpn-design-system.png" class="img-fluid" alt="lpn-design-system">
            </div>

            <h3>Hi-fi mockups</h3>
            <p>After a feedback round with the client, I continued to transform the wireframes into hi-fi mockups. I designed the high fidelity mock ups in Figma with weekly discussions and iterations involving all stakeholders.</p>
