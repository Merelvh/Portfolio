                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p>The client asked us to make a design for their new affiliate website BestDayDeals which required a:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>home page that would display all products without categories,</li>
                    <li>product page which should consist of product information and highlights, volume discount
                        options,
                        payment method and a countdown timer of 30 minutes. Users would only land on this
                        website through another one by clicking on a specific productlink.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>My role</h2>
                <p>My role as an intern at Activate Your Business in this project was to define the specific needs and
                    goals, creating wireframes and being responsible for most of the ultimate design. In this project I
                    was the main designer, receiving feedback from my supervisor. </p>
                <h2>The goal</h2>
                <p>The goal of the website is therefore a quick and easy checkout process as the customer already knows
                    which product they would like to purchase. </p>
                <p>The goal of the client is to let the customer check out as soon as possible and for them to not
                    leave the page in the meantime. To reach this goal, the customer must have the opportunity to check
                    out on the page as where the product is shown. The customer needs as few steps as possible to
                    achieve this goal.</p>
                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>My research mainly focused on the product page as this is the first page customers will land on when
                    clicking on a product link. </p>
                <p>To understand which elements should be present in the design, it was necessary to empathize with
                    both the client and the customer and keeping the goals in consideration. </p>
                <p>I started with gathering information about affiliate websites. My research consisted of analyzing
                    multiple similar websites where customers land by clicking on an affiliate link.</p>
                <p>I also searched for websites that utilize one-page checkout principles to understand what is
                    necessary
                    for an easy and fast checkout process. Examples that fit this criterea are Dribbble and Behance.</p>
                <p>We want to guide the customer in a certain direction using persuasive design, however with an
                    ethical point of view. This means that it needs to provides a reasonable benefit to both the client
                    and the customer. </p>
                <p>In my design I considered following five principles of persuasive design.</p>
                <ol>
                    <h3>
                        <li>Clarity above all</li>
                    </h3>
                    <p>For the customers it’s important to quickly see what kind of site it is, what they can do there
                        and what could be expected from them. </p>
                    <p>Therefore, the affiliate website should make it easy for
                        them to find sufficient product information and to make it clear that they can buy the product
                        on the same page. This also means that the entire check out procedure is represented on the same
                        page. This way we provide clarity and transparency.</p>
                    <h3>
                        <li>Visual appeal</li>
                    </h3>
                    <p>On the affiliate website, the first impression is the most important one, because it simply
                        doesn’t
                        get another chance. The customer just lands on the product page and can either buy the product
                        or
                        leave the site. </p>
                    <h3>
                        <li>Strong visual hierarchy</li>
                    </h3>
                    <p>It is important to show the product information with the most significance. This
                        would be by followed by the checkout procedure. </p>
                    <p>Considering visual hierarchy, I divided the colors into four commonly used ecommerce
                        color groups: Call to action, Urgence Association, Positive Association, Trusted Assocation.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        <li>Conserve attention</li>
                    </h3>
                    <p>To get the customers attention, I wanted to use popping colors and provide the most important
                        information above the fold, as this is where 80% of user attention takes place. </p>
                    <h3>
                        <li>One primary action per screen</li>
                    </h3>
                    <p>The primary action for the affiliate website would be buying the product. We don’t want to
                        distract the customer with related products, links to categories or other information. </p>
                </ol>
                <h2>Wireframing</h2>
                <p>After gathering enough examples and inspiration, I started creating Lo-Fi wireframes. I used the
                    wireframes to define the allocation of elements on the pages and to receive feedback from the client
                    without them getting distracted by the overall look and feel of the UI. </p>
                <p>I created multiple wireframes with different layouts to be able to start a brainstorm session about
                    the best implementation, for both mobile and desktop.</p>
                <div class="my-4">
                    <img src="content/affiliate-wireframes-mobile.png" class="img-fluid" alt="wireframes-mobile">
                </div>
                <p>At first, we wanted the checkout procedure to be above the first fold together with the product
                    information. By creating an accordion type of checkout procedure, all the steps are directly visible
                    which provides clarity for the customer in completing the process.</p>
                <div class="my-4">
                    <img src="content/affiliate-website-wireframe-productshow-1.png" class="img-fluid"
                        alt="wireframes-mobile">
                </div>
                <p> Instead of the checkout process being above the first fold, they would like to fully use that space
                    for the product information. To meet their expectations, but also deliver a good user experience and
                    and achieve the goals, I made some informed changes to the design.</p>
                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>To create urgency, a sticky countdown timer is added on the top of the screen with a prominent,
                    attention-getting color. Below the product information, another element of urgency is placed which
                    is still visible when the customer scrolls down the page. </p>
                <p>All product information is clearly presented above the first fold. Reviews about the product can be
                    seen at the bottom of the page by clicking on the number of reviews. </p>
                <p>Above the first fold, a CTA button is placed in a prominent place to guide the customer to the
                    checkout process below, because the checkout procedure isn’t visible above the first fold.
                    The checkout process is fully “unfolded” to show all the steps to the customer and creating an even
                    more transparent process.</p>
                <p>By default, the highest discount option in the volume discount section is selected. This is being
                    made clear by clear use of colors, discount labels and a checkmark. </p>
                <p>The input fields offer floating labels so the customer had the possibility to see which field
                    they’re filling in.</p>
                <p>At the shipping details section, the switch for delivery address is the same as details is selected
                    by default, same for standard delivery.</p>

                <div class="row my-4">
                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <img src="content/affiliate-website-productshow-no-blur.png" class="img-fluid"
                            alt="prototype-productshow">
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <img src="content/affiliate-website-homepage-no-blur.png" class="img-fluid"
                            alt="prototype-homepage">
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>Handoff</h2>
                <p>After completing the design, I saved one version for the developers including the assets for colors
                    and elements and different statuses of the components. </p>
                <p>
                    A key point this project taught me was to adapt and respond with changes that are being made during
                    the design process while also maintaining the original goals of the client.
