                        <p>Activate your Business sells their Software as a service (SaaS) to existing clients and
                            companies. They want to give it a new identity and create a marketing website to sell it
                            more easily to
                            new clients.</p>

                        <h2>My role</h2>
                        <p><strong>UX/UI designer & developer</strong></p>
                        <p>Research, wireframing, visual design, development.</p>
                        <p>My role as an intern at Activate Your Business was that of the main designer receiving
                            feedback from my supervisor and being co-responsible of the development in Wordpress using
                            HTML, SCSS and PHP.
                        </p>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>Requirements and goals</h2>
                <p>The new identity must portray that of an intuitive software. It may be completely separate from the
                    Activate your Business B.V. website because there it’s more about the company and the services and
                    this is about the software product.</p>
                <p>The software and functionalities needs to be explained in an accessible and illustrative way. The
                    design for this must be playful and fresh but easily expandable.</p>
                <p>It’s important that the appearance can stand on its own, but that it’s close to the style of Activate
                    your Business B.V. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unique look,</li>
                    <li>clear navigation structure (main purpose is to request a demo),</li>
                    <li>beautiful landing pages for the various parts of the software, the design must be playful but
                        easily expandable,</li>
                    <li>clearly show that it’s one integral software with all the different modules that together make
                        it a one-solution software,</li>
                    <li>knowledge base in which the various functionalities of the software can be explained, including
                        good search and filter functions,</li>
                    <li>customer slider,</li>
                    <li>overview of links with external partners,</li>
                    <li>the website must ultimately be able to sell the software without our intervention.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Sitemap</h2>
                <p>For establishing a proper information architecture and hierarchy, I created a sitemap. We kept into
                    account that none of the pages should be more than three clicks away from any other page. Hence,
                    every single page has a lot of internal links to each other. So instead of creating a deep sitemap,
                    I created a flat sitemap to portray the most important connections from the homepage. </p>
                <div class="my-4">
                    <img src="content/saas-sitemap.png" class="img-fluid" alt="sitemap-saas">
                </div>
                <h2>Wireframing</h2>
                <p>I started with gaining inspiration by looking at similar and competing websites. I did this by
                    searching marketing websites on Google, but also by getting inspiration from sites like Dribbble and
                    Behance. </p>
                <p>The next step was creating wireframes to clarify the overall placing of elements, to decide
                    consistent ways for displaying the information and to show functionality of and paths between the
                    pages.</p>
                <div class="row my-4">
                    <div class="col-6">
                        <img src="content/saas-wireframe1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="wireframe-saas">
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-6">
                        <img src="content/saas-wireframe2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="wireframe-saas">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>The idea of the marketing website is that most pages could serve as landing pages and therefore
                    establish conversion. Hence, the pageheaders are broadly the same on every page and offer a clean
                    visual hierarchy. The most important CTA is placed above the first fold (request a demo). The CTA
                    button stays in the sticky top navigation while users scroll down the page. </p>
                <p>The sections on the homepage are placed in an order to tell a story and to lay out a route we want
                    each visitor to follow. Every section has its own CTA and hierarchy. </p>
                <p>The request demo section is part of the footer and therefore displayed on every page. The custom post
                    type pages all include a section for frequently asked questions to provide the information that the
                    visitor is looking for. </p>
                <p>By meeting the requirements of a fresh and playful design, I used, among other things, popping
                    colors, clear illustrations and enough whitespace to let each section and the elements “breathe”.
                </p>

                <h2>Development</h2>
                <p>What made this project exciting for me, is that I had the opportunity to make my design come to life
                    by being co-responsible for the development. </p>
                <p>The web resource is hosted on WordPress and I used HTML, Bootstrap, SCSS and PHP to visualize the
                    designs.</p>
