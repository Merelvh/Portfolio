                    <h3>About the project</h3>
                    <p>For the project I was challenged by a company to create a workflow for an e-learning app on a
                        topic of my choice. The app should motivate beginners to learn new skills and facilitate
                        learning. The design and user experience should be intuitive and easy to use for complete
                        beginners. </p>
                    <p>The workflow must consist of a set of screens (max 20 screens) encompassing a logical and
                        intuitive navigation. It was not necessary to make an extensive workflow, but just core screens.
                    </p>
                    <p>Styling must be interesting and eye-catching. A brand identity document wasnâ€™t necessary. </p>
                    <p>Following features should be included: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Task overview</li>
                        <li>Single lesson example</li>
                        <li>Single lesson exercise</li>
                        <li>Progress tracker</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>During this project my role as UX/UI designer was to complete the assignment during the
                        application procedure and to receive feedback from the company. I kept a document with my notes
                        during the process and logged my hours. I enjoyed working on this assignment a lot and spend
                        around 11 hours on the project. </p>

            <h2>Competitive research</h2>

            </ul>
            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>Most apps show just different drawings in a step-by-step process. In the reviews users place comments
                about that they rather watch YouTube videos or gain more background knowledge. </p>
            <p>Drawing apps out there provide different cartoon-ish drawing with a step-by-step process that they can
                execute on a paper. </p>
            <p>Drawing & Painting provides a collection of categorized YouTube videos for different types of drawings.
            </p>
            <p>Sketch a Day gives prompts for people to make an artwork and share within the app with other users.</p>

            <h2>Brief</h2>
            <p>What is the problem?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There isn't a proper app out there to learn how to draw following proper lessons, videos and doing
                    tests. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>What does it do?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Teaching people how to draw or improve their drawing skills and test their knowledge. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>How does it work?</p>
            <ul>

                    drawing and test their knowledge. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Why should someone use it?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It provides a fun and interactive tool to learn how to draw.</li>
            </ul>

                    from real draw fanatics. </li>

            <ul>
                <li>Receive feedback from real draw fanatics. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>What makes this app different from competitors? </p>

            </ul>
            <h2>User persona</h2>
            <p>Based on the defining of the target audience, I created a user persona to understand and empathize with
                the target audience.</p>
            <h2>User journey map</h2>
            <p>After creating a user persona and defining the app requirements, I created a user journey map to look at
                the app from the user's point of view. It helped me understand and address user needs and pain points.
            </p>
            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>First, I created a number of empty screens and started writing down in bullet points what it should
                contain. The next step was to map out the functionality of screens and to create a logical placement of
                elements and features. </p>
            <p>The dashboard/overview shows an overview of the course completion and motivates the user to start the
                next lesson or do a quiz. </p>
            <p>The lessons would consist of an educational video, text and photos. After lessons, there would be a
                practical assignment where users use their knowledge to create drawings. The drawing will be reviewed by
                other users according to review criteria. But first the user needs to review he drawings of at least two
                other users. </p>
            <p>Quizzes are included in the features to motivate the user to learn more about art. With quizzes the user
                can earn points for the leaderboard. Every quiz shows its progress of completion. Every completed quiz
                gives 10% completion. When the user makes a mistake, theyâ€™ll lose a heart for which they have to wait
                before they regenerate. This waiting in between makes the user want to keep playing the game. </p>
            <p>I added a point system and leaderboard that motivates the user to continue learning to score high on the
                leaderboard. </p>

            <h2>The design</h2>
            <p>For the design I wanted it to portray a playful look and made use of joyful illustrations. </p>
            <p>I choose orange for the primary color and blue (on the opposite of the color wheel) to be the secondary
                color. The color psychology of orange is that it portrays creativeness, positivism, optimism but also
                encouragement and motivation. </p>

            <h2>Prototype</h2>
            <p>I created a clickable prototype in Adobe XD to show the workflow and the connection between the screens.
            </p>
            <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/b27f4ce0-c60c-4339-8171-6d6554c81da3-e72c/screen/3c37fd84-4331-4dba-a17c-625442bdb5f7?fullscreen" class="link p-1"
                target="_blank">Clickable prototype in Adobe XD <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i></a>
            <h2>User testing</h2>
            <p>When I finished my clickable prototype, I asked one user to use it while I observed. To receive feedback,
                I asked some testing questions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is the first thing you notice on this screen? </li>
                <li>What is the first thing you would do on this screen? </li>
                <li>Your task is X. What would be the first thing you would do here to accomplish that task? </li>
                <li>Is there anything on this screen that seems out of place? </li>
                <li>Is the prototype easy to use? </li>
                <li>What would you change about the prototype? </li>
            </ul>
