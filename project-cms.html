            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>About the project</h2>
                <p>Activate Your Business maintains the Content Management System (CMS) for one of their clients. This
                    includes fixing bugs or making minor changes to the system. The client expressed their wish for
                    redesigning the CMS.</p>
                <p>The client provides a Dutch platform for legal aid recipients to easily find the help or advice they
                    need. Lawyers utilize this platform for lead generation, enabling them to scale up opportunities. It
                    makes legal services accessible to a wide group of entrepreneurs and private individuals. </p>
                <p>A request is first submitted to an intake desk. Sometimes a digital solution is sufficient, in other
                    cases it is presented to a lawyer after which they can accept or refuse the incoming lead in a
                    limited amount of time. The employees handling the incoming leads are mostly law students or
                    lawyers.</p>
                <p>The company uses a CMS which is used by lawyers, clients and employees of the company. </p>
                <h2>My role</h2>
                <p>During this project my role as an intern at Activate Your Business was to define the pain points and
                    problems of the current system and defining goals. My task was to conduct user research and compose
                    user personas and journey maps. The outcome of the project would be components used in a
                    presentation pitch which I presented for our team. </p>
                <h2>Approach</h2>
                <p>Because the system is so big, our team decided to first focus on the redesign of the CMS-interface
                    used by lawyers. We focused on the interface facing the lawyers as they are the primary recenue
                    source for this product, and the other user interfaces were much more extensive or out of scope.</p>
                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>I began by conducting user research to discover more information about the users themselves and their
                    needs. The user research consisted of gathering information about lawyers on different platforms,
                    like on the existing legal aid website. On this website all lawyers provide a summary about who they
                    are, their personality and their services. </p>
                <p>Another source of infromation I used during the research was Google Analytics. Based on the insights
                    from Google Analytics, there’s a negligible difference between the amount of female and male users.
                    Based on the type of devices being used, for the current system it’s mostly desktop. The main reason
                    for this is most likely because the CMS doesn’t offer a mobile friendly user interface. </p>
                <h2>User persona</h2>
                <p>Based on my research I created one user persona that largely defines the target group. This included
                    the personality traits, goals, frustrations, motivations and the most used devices.</p>
                <p>To create a realistic picture of the target group, it was important for me to empathize with the user
                    as well as their goals and needs as a lawyer.</p>
                <p>My previous experience as a speech therapist worked in my (advantage/favor), as I was already
                    familiar with working with different types of Electronic Health Records (EHR). My experience as the
                    user helped me empathize and realize what the needs are when using the system. </p>
                <div class="my-4">
                    <img src="content/redesign-cms-user-persona.png" class="img-fluid" alt="user-persona">
                </div>
                <h2>Behavior flow</h2>
                <p>I also analyzed the behavior flow on Google Analytics. The high bounce percentage on the dashboard
                    page stood out the most. A hypothesis for this result would be that lawyers receive an email on
                    their phone to accept an incoming lead. After accepting they will be transferred to the dashboard.
                </p>
                <p>Though it was quite hard to analyze the information since employees of the company also could enter
                    the same portal as lawyers. Because this made my research more complicated and didn’t result in
                    “clean” results, I decided it was more effective to conduct usability research. This would give me
                    more valuable information since I could actually see how users use the program and start a
                    conversation to discover the pain points. </p>
                <h2>Usability test</h2>
                <p>For my usability research I let two people use the system. It was a remote test on Google Meet where
                    I gave them tasks to fulfill in the system and asking them questions about their experience.</p>
                <p>The usability research provided me with way more valuable information than I could ever find in
                    Google Analytics in my opinion. </p>
                <p>One of the participants had never used or seen the system before. The other participant had seen it
                    before and checked if leads were received in a good way in the employee login, but she never used
                    the login for lawyers. </p>
                <p>After a short introduction about the system and as which type of user they would use the system, I
                    asked the participants a few questions and tasks to fulfil. During the tasks I was aware of how much
                    time it took for them to complete it. Some of the questions and tasks were:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Without doing anything, what do you think happens when you click on ...?</li>
                    <li>Edit the phone number of one active lead.</li>
                    <li>If you were looking for an invoice, where would you expect to find it?</li>
                    <li>What are your thoughts as you view this page or during fulfilling this task?</li>
                    <li>What are your thoughts on the wording used?</li>
                    <li>What do you think about the design and layout?</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="my-4">
                    <img src="content/usability-test.png" class="img-fluid" alt="usability-test-screenshot">
                </div>
                <h3>Results</h3>
                <p>In general, the participants were averagely pleased about the experience. Some information they could
                    quite easily find in the system.</p>
                <p>However, there were a few pain points. Both participants struggled with the wording every now and
                    then
                    and to find specific information that I asked them to find. Information that is normally probably
                    regularly used, like active leads and invoices. This created frustration. </p>
                <p>Another example of a pain point is when the user was asked to add a note to the file, they struggled
                    to find the
                    note after they created it. </p>
                <p>Besides, both participants said they lacked options to return to the previous screen after they
                    fulfilled an action. Also, both participants find the design outdated and non-attractive. </p>
                <h2>Problem statements</h2>
                <p>Some problem statements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The current form of the system does not provide a mobile friendly version, only a desktop
                        version. According to the company there is need for a mobile friendly version since more and
                        more lawyers would like to view their information from different devices throughout the day.
                    </li>
                    <li>The interface is on average easy to use for first time users with technical knowledge, but maybe
                        not for those without.</li>
                    <li>The navigation and the wording is being perceived as confusing sometimes. </li>
                    <li>On multiple parts of the CMS, too much, too little, or irrelevant information is shown that
                        confuses or even overwhelms the user. </li>
                    <li>The interface is due for renewal since it is perceived as outdated and non-attractive.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>After defining the problems/pain points, I turned those into goals. The CMS for lawyers should:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>provide an efficient and easy-to-use CMS for lawyers without required training,</li>
                    <li>offer a mobile friendly interface,</li>
                    <li>provide relevant information and minimize the number of options,</li>
                    <li>offer an aesthetic pleasing user interface.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>User journey map</h2>
                <p>Based on the usability test and the user persona, I created a user journey map to visualize the user
                    experience. Instead of focusing the journey map on the current system, I focused on the ideal
                    situation of the new system. This way I was able to more rapidly visualize which components to
                    design.</p>
                <div class="my-4">
                    <img src="content/redesign-cms-user-journey-map.png" class="img-fluid" alt="user-journey-map">
                </div>
                <h2>The design</h2>
                <p>My approach was to make a mobile-first design. </p>
                <p>For a proper CMS design, it was important for me to anticipate on the most commonly used tools
                    and to make those immediately accessible. Hence the least or not used tools should be limited or
                    omitted from the interface for the specific user, in this case the lawyer.</p>
                <p>By following the steps in the user journey map, it was easier for me to visualize the types of
                    components. Also, by using the results from the usability test it was clearer to me which
                    elements should be included or excluded. </p>
                <p>The current CMS didn’t convey a proper brand identity of the client. By looking at it, it could
                    be from any other company. I made it my goal during the redesign to convey a clear brand identity
                    that would convey a trustworthy, consistent, and unambiguous system that makes more sense
                    to the user. This also includes creating a style guide to keep one line in all the designs. </p>
                <p>The outcome of the project was a collection of different UI components for the new CMS and a
                    pitch
                    presentation including all the above products/outcomes.</p>
